Clustering is often used together with PCA (Principal Components Analysis) which is a form of unsupervised dimensionality reduction: data sets with \"high dimensionality\" are reduced using PCA (you can think of this as a realignment of the axes with the 'data cloud') which has the effect of _maximising the variance_ on each new axis, and the reduced-dimension dataset is then fed to a clustering algorithm. Similarly, supervised approaches are often paired: logistic regression (supervised) is often used with classification (supervised).\n",

In that case, I want my clusters to take geography into account. That approach might classify an area with a smaller proportion of cancer patients as part of a 'cancer cluster' but that's because it is still significant _because_ of the geography.\n",

I would then consider using PCA on groups of related variables (_e.g._ the housing features as a group, the ethnicity features as a group, etc.) and then take the first few eigenvalues from each group and cluster on all of those together. This would remove quite a bit of the correlation between variables and still allow us to perform hierarchical and other types of clustering on the result. It would also do a better job of preserving outliers.\n",

The idea is that you plot the average WCSS for each number of possible clusters in the range of interest (`2...n`) and then look for a 'knee' (i.e. kink) in the curve. The principle of this approach is that you look for the point where there is declining benefit from adding more clusters. The problem is that there is always _some_ benefit to adding more clusters (the perfect clustering is _k==n_), so you don't always see a knee. \n",

    "Another way to try to make the process of selecting the number of clusters a little less arbitrary is called the silhouette plot and (like WCSS) it allows us to evaluate the 'quality' of the clustering outcome by examining the distance between each observation and the rest of the cluster. In this case it's based on Partitioning Around the Medoid (PAM). \n",
